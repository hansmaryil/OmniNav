This week, we modified the mechanical design of the pouch to include a slot for inserting the microUSB cable to load firmware onto the Pololu A-Star 32U4 micro. We also finished 3-D printing our modified fanny pouch with the cover and the four vibration motor casings. The 3-D printed fanny pouch with all the components can be seen below. The two 3.7V lithium ion - polymer batteries can be seen at the top left corner, the HC-05 bluetooth module at the bottom right corner, the level shifter at the bottom left corner, the IMU at the bottom, the Pololu micro at the center, the blue voltage regulator for the motors at the top and finally the two motor drivers surround the micro.

The 3-D printed motor casing with the vibration motor can be seen below.

With all the components at hand, we are all set to start building our first functioning prototype!
