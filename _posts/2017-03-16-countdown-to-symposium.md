# We're Finally Here

We've finally reached the day before the Symposium.  Tomorrow's demo marks the culmination of 8 months of hard work. We've shot a video that helps let people know about our product.  It is embedded below and will be posted on our home page for easy access soon!

Check out our booth (#14) at Davis Centre, Waterloo, ON, tomorrow, March, 17th, 2017 between 1 and 5 pm.  Also, don't forget to vote for us in the People's Choice Award.
