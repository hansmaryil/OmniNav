Hi everyone,

As we look on the past 4 months, we can reminisce on the times spent together as a group and the new concepts we've learned.  Each person in our group has contributed significantly to the overall success of the project.  Even during times of uncertainity and issues faced by hardware/software not working, the group was able to make a concerted effort towards coming up with elegant solutions.

The following is a photo taken at the Symposium with our group and the poster setup.  We'd like to thank all those who took the time to come out and listen to us during the Symposium.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

</div>

Thanks everyone for following our progress on this project throughout the past few months.  It's been a pleasure!

Best Regards,

OmniNav Team
